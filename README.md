My first attempt at game programming. This is a simple target shooting game built in macroquad.

## Rules

- Hit a target to increase score by 1
- Score decreases rapidly
- Don't let score hit 0
- Use WASD to move
- Use space to fire
- Pressing A before firing will flip the direction you fire in

## How to run

Simply clone this repository then `cargo run`
