My first attempt at game programming. This is a simple target shooting game built in macroquad.

## Rules

- Only one bullet is allowed to be on the screen at any given time
- Hit a target to increase score
- Use WASD to move
- Pressing A before firing will flip the direction you fire in

## How to run

Simply clone this repository then `cargo run`
